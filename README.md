# Learning-HTML
This repository is for learning HTML and CSS basics. This will also serve as reading material learnt from tutorials. HTML is nothing but markup and all the styling is taken care by CSS. Logic part is taken care by JavaScript.

I haven't ignored .vscode since it contains my favoured vscode settings for HTML which I may not use for python and hence I wanted it locally.

# Notes HTML
index.html is always the homepage of the website

Head has nothing to do with the output that is shown in the browser. It has page title. Links to javascript and css files. Meta data such as the description and the keyword.
In the body we have the actual markup that is displayed in the webpage

For example href provided in link is an attribute which directs it to another location. 

Navigation bar that we see at the top of the website is an unordered list that has been styled
